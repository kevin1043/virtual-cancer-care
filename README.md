# Virtual Cancer Care

Virtual Cancer Care is a web-based application that utilizes three prediction-based models to predict the chances of lung cancer, breast cancer, and ALL (leukemia) cancer. The leukemia cancer prediction model is based on advanced image classification technology.

## Introduction

The Virtual Cancer Care website is currently under development and provides prediction tools for lung cancer, breast cancer, and ALL (leukemia) cancer. Users are required to sign up and log in to access the prediction tools, ensuring confidentiality and privacy. The website also features a unique report generation feature that allows users to generate a PDF report summarizing the chances of predictions made by the website. Additionally, a dashboard is available for users to log their predictions and track their health progress over time.

## Tech Stack

- Django 3.2: A high-level Python web framework for building web applications.
- Python 3.6: The programming language used for developing the application.
- TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework used for the leukemia cancer prediction model based on image classification.
- Djongo: A database connector that allows Django to use MongoDB as the backend database.
